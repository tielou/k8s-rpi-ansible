# k8s-rpi-ansible
This Ansible playbook deploys a fully featured Kubernetes cluster built on a set of Raspberry Pi's.
It includes the following features:
* Kubernetes v1.18.2
* Flannel-based networking v0.12
* (multiple) NFS shares across the Raspberry Pi's and the necessary client provisioner to create PVC's
* Traefik v2.2 deployment as ingress load balancer for services with automatic Let's Encrypt capabilities
* Deployment mechanism for manifests as defined in my other repository: [tielou/kubernetes-manifests-rpi](https://github.com/tielou/kubernetes-manifests-rpi)
* Full idempotency of the playbook

## Prerequisites
To successfully deploy Kubernetes with this playbook you need to set up some prerequisites before the first run:
* Have a set of at least two Raspberry Pi's running with direct network connectivity
* Fresh install of Raspbian Buster Lite on the RPI's (this was developed with version [raspbian_lite-2020-02-14](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/images/raspbian_lite-2020-02-14/2020-02-13-raspbian-buster-lite.zip) )
* SSH connectivity to the RPI's with public key authentication from the deployment computer
* Ansible 2.9.6 installed on the deployment computer
* Static IP's for the RPI's (and preferrably hostnames). See [this](https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/how-to-give-your-raspberry-pi-a-static-ip-address-update)

## Usage
Clone this git repository by running:
```
git clone https://github.com/tielou/k8s-rpi-ansible.git
```
Open the `vars/main.yml` in your favorite text editor and adjust the values as desired. Find a detailed declaration further down.
Afterwards open the `Ã¬nventory` file and adjust the IP's accordingly to the static ones you set for your RPI's. If you want to connect to the RPI's through another user than `pi` change the `ansible_ssh_user` variable.
If you would like to verify the connectivity and the Ansible configuration you can run:
````
ansible all -i inventory -m ping
```
If this succeeds you can trigger the execution of the playbook by running:
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory main.yml
```

After the run succeeded you can verify the funtionality by running:
`kubectl get nodes`
```

### Traefik
This playbook deploys Traefik 2.2 as ingress load balancer for the Kubernetes setup. Traefik exposes 2 public ports with this configuration on the nodes:
* 80 for http (you can enable immediate redirect for all http traffic in the `traefik-ingress.yml`)
* 443 for https
Services with a Traefik ingress route will be exposed on all nodes through those ports. Traefik does the routing based on hostnames, thus you need a matching configruation for the hosts you have defined (public dns records, local dns records or modified hosts file).
For all services which get exposed through 443, Traefik will automatically try to obtain a valid certificate from Let's Encrypt.
In order for this to work make sure to fill in your proper e-mail address in the `traefik-ingress.yml` manifest and eventually switch to the production Let's Encrypt server (as default LE server, their staging server is set).

You can find a sample Traefik configuration for a service at https://github.com/tielou/kubernetes-manifests-rpi/blob/master/traefik/sample-service.yml

You can find the Traefik dashboard at `http://x.x.x.x:8080/dashboard/` Replace `x.x.x.x` with any of your node IP's

## Variables

* `deploy_user` Define the user as which the whole playbook should be installed. For Raspbian the default user is `pi`.
* `kubernetes_version` Define the desired K8S version here, please be aware this is the Debian specific version number. This was tested with `1.18.2-00`.
* `nfs_shares` Define your desired NFS shares here. The `share` variable reflects the path of the mount on the nfs server whereas `mount` specifies the mount path on the client side.
* `nfs_master_ip` Define the static ip of your NFS server. This is used for the mounts on the client RPI's as well as for the nfs client provisioner deployment.
* `pod_network_cidr` Define your desired cidr range for the pods inside Kubernetes here. If you change the default, make sure to also adjust the variable `Network` in `flannel-networking.yml`, line 129.
* `kubeconfig_path` Define where you would like to store your Kubernetes configuration locally.
* `k8s_user_manifests` If you would like to deploy additional Kubernetes manifests declare them here and put them in `manifests/user`. You can set the namespace here, which will be created if not present. This playbook includes a sample deployment for Nextcloud.
